Sorry for the delay in getting back to.  I had to clean the dataset.  I uploaded to OneDrive which the IRB likes because its secure.  I didn't want to download another cloud app on my laptop :)

Please let me know if anything is unclear.  Right now I have RNAseq data only for patients who had whole blood plus Trizol (n=48).  Originally was 60 but there were some duplicates and some patients we had poor quality (insufficient mRNA).

I have not provided data for the control dataset yet (no COVID).  I have some students working on that one (data extraction).

Have a great weekend,

Lu
